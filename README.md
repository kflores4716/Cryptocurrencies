# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised learning to process cryptocurrency data for a client. They are a large investment firm who are interested in breaking into cryptocurrencies, but they don't have much knowledge or experience with this new tradeable resource. They have provided us with a data set, so the first thing we did was filter out the rows and columns that we didn't need or couldn't use in our model. Once we did that, we scaled our data and reduced it's dimension using our `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`. We then created an elbow curve to decide how many clusters to use, settling on 4, and initialized a `K-Means` model to make predictions. After the predictions were made, we created a 3D scatter plot to visualize those predictions. Lastly, we filtered our data frame to show how many tradeable currencies there are, and also scaled our data to create a new, more legible table showing the different cryptocurrencies along with their total coin supply and total coins mined.

To complete this analysis, we used data from a `.csv` file and processed it uding `Jupyter Notebook`.
